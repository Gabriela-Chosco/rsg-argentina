## [12-08] RSG Argentina - 10 years of stories 

On August 12, 2020, the founders of RSG-Argentina will hold a cycle of talks to tell us how their careers have changed during these years. The same day we will have the honor of having the presence of Prof. Christine Orengo who will deliver a Keynote lecture. Prof. Orengo is the President of the International Society for Computational Biology and first woman to achieve this position. She will present the talk: "SARS-CoV-2 and its predicted infectivity in mammals" along other stories about her trajectory as a key researcher in our field. At the end we will have a round table to reflect on how Bioinformatics has changed over the years, which plans are there for the future and what can we do to improve.

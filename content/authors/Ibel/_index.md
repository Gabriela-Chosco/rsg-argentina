# About me 

I have a degree in Hemotherapy and Immunohematology, graduated with honors from the University of Concepción del Uruguay. I have studied transfusion medicine at the Eva Perón de San Martín Hospital and clinical analysis at the Dr. Ignacio Pirovano Hospital. I'm currently working as a PhD student at the Laboratory of Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning, IIBIO-UNSAM, studying the immune response against tumor cells for the development of cancer vaccines. I teach Immunohematology at the University of Concepción del Uruguay and different courses of biological data analysis.

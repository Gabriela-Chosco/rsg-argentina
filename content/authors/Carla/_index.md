# About me 
I am currently working on my thesis to obtain the degree in Bsc/MSc in Biotechnology at the Microbiological Industrial Process Pilot Plant (PROIMI-CONICET). My work focuses on the prediction of plasmids and resistance proteins in prokaryotic organisms from a semi-automatic computer analysis of NGS data.

# About me 
Hello, I'm Facundo, a Genetics undergraduate student at the National University of Misiones. I'm passionate about bioinformatics and constantly improving my skills in database analysis and programming. My main focus is Python, but I'm also interested in learning other languages like R. I'm eager to contribute to the field of genetics and bioinformatics. Thank you!

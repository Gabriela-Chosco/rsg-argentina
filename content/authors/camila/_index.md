# About me 
I have a Bioinformatics BSc/MSc degree from the Faculty of Engineering of the National University of Entre Ríos (Argentina). During my studies, I have acquired several skills such as programming in multiple languages (Python, C++, Java, MATLAB), software designing, version control tools such as GitHub, writing skills, critical thinking and teamwork. I also acquired a solid background in molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, macromolecular structures, genetics, and sequence analysis and alignment. Also, as a university student, I published two articles in scientific journals, one of them as the first author, two oral presentations at scientific meetings, and participated as a poster presenter or assistant in 17 national or international conferences. Moreover, I took several courses about programming languages that allowed me to complement my academic training. In the last couple of years, I have had unique and valuable remote collaborations working with different national and international research teams. From 2020 to 2022, I have experience with biological modelling, especially with agent-based models applied to epidemiology. Currently, I am working on protein modelling and signalization, particularly in shuttling mechanisms of ARGONAUTES proteins in eukaryotic organisms and the analysis of putative protein interaction.  Regarding languages, I am native in Spanish, I have an advanced level of English and an elementary level of German. I consider myself passionate, organized and persevering. In addition, my friends and colleagues highlight my responsibility, proactivity and adaptability. I aspire to do a doctorate and participate in new projects to continue learning and developing as a professional.

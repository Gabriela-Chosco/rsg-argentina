# About me 

I am an Argentinian Scientist specialised in bioinformatics and computational biology. 

My research interest includes Protein Domains analysis, Protein Folding, Local Frustration, Repeat Proteins, Embryonic Stem Cells, Transcriptional regulation and Bioinformatics in general.

Along with my career development, I was always involved in teaching activities, being part of university subjects and different types of courses as well. I have been involved in courses like "Introduction to programming", "Algorithms and Data Structures" and "Biomolecular Structures". Additionally, I have been strongly involved in scientific communities in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology both at the Argentinian and the international level, which led me to develop my soft skills and consequently a strong leadership profile. I have been leading and being part of several organization committees for several symposia and conferences in Argentina and other countries, mostly as a part of the ISCB Student Council (http://www.iscbsc.org/).

Topics: Gene expression and transcriptional analysis, single cell transcriptomics, protein structures analysis, protein modelling, computational simulations, local frustration analysis, databases.

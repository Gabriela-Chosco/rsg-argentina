# About me 

I hold a BSc. in Bioinformatics and a PhD in Computer Science. I am currently a bit removed from bioinformatics, working on cheminformatics specifically in materials informatics. One of my greatest pride is to belong to RSG-Argentina, collaborating in the dissemination of bioinformatics for undergraduate and graduate students, motivating them to become colleagues. I'm not really passionate about writing this bio.
